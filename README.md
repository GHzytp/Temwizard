What is TEMWizard?
==================

Atomap is a software tool for determining the position and other qualities of atomic columns in STEM-images. The tool requires user inputs on image qualities such as atom distance and sublattice location. Our application, TemWizard, is used to visualize intermediate and final results from Atomap, which makes it easier for the user to provide the correct inputs to the Atomap. Python, D3, and the Atomap library were integrated with Flask, a Python web framework. The final result from the Temwizard framework is an interactive visualization of the Atomap results.

Installation
======================

1. Download or clone the repository

2. Open Terminal

3. cd to the folder "flask" within temwizard (example below, you can type cd in Terminal and then drag the flask folder to the terminal to quickly get the address)

`cd ...temwizard/flask`

4. create virtual environment

`python -m venv venv`

5. activate virtual environment 

(mac)

`source venv/bin/activate`

(windows)

`venv\Scripts\activate`

6. Install all necessary packages

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

7. run flask

`flask run`

8. Go to local address

`http://127.0.0.1:5000`

9. Select atom by clicking on the center dot. The other atoms will be filtered out depending on if their values fall within the ranges indicated on the left. Click again of the dot to reset
