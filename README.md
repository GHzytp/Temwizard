What is TEMWizard?
==================

TEMWizard is used to visualize intermediate and final results from Atomap, an open-source software tool for determining the position and other features of atomic columns in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images. TEMWizard provides an easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI) for Atomap, allowing the user to provide correct inputs and visualize lattice displacements for analysis of phenomena such as octahedral rotations or bond distortions. It is built atop Python and D3, using  the Atomap library integrated ih Flask, a Python web framework.

Installation
======================

1. Download or clone the repository

2. Open Terminal

3. cd to the folder "flask" within temwizard (example below, you can type cd in Terminal and then drag the flask folder to the terminal to quickly get the address)

`cd ...temwizard/flask`

4. create virtual environment

`python -m venv venv`

5. activate virtual environment 

(mac)

`source venv/bin/activate`

(windows)

`venv\Scripts\activate`

6. Install all necessary packages

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

7. run flask

`flask run`

8. Go to local address

`http://127.0.0.1:5000`

9. Select atom by clicking on the center dot. The other atoms will be filtered out depending on if their values fall within the ranges indicated on the left. Click again of the dot to reset
